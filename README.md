This script lists all files in a directory and prepares them for ip address removal. 
It scans all text in the files and uses regex to replace any ip addresses with "***.***.***.***"

Requires user to entire the filepath of the root directory and it will loop through all files found, and ask if user wants to sanitize the list of files found.


any improvements/suggestions to my code are appreciated.
